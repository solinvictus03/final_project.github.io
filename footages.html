                        The Boys. He is the former CEO of Vought International and the superior of Madelyn Stillwell.
                        Although he initially keeps to himself while conducting business, he decides to take a more
                        direct approach in managing Vought and its assets, such as The Seven, following Stillwell's
                        death. He began his career as an associate for Vought American in 1984 and eventually rose up to
                        become the chief executive of the modern-day Vought International due to his calm, collected,
                        and ruthless personality. As one of the few people who shows no fear towards Homelander, Edgar
                        is the cool-headed puppet-master with a shadowy past; he pulled the strings that move Vought
                        forward, no matter the cost.</div>

                        within Vought International, a media conglomerate that owns The Seven. As a result, she worked
                        closely with the Seven frequently. As Vought’s Senior Vice President of Hero Management, it was
                        Madelyn Stillwell’s job to manage the world’s greatest superhero team, The Seven. It was also
                        her job to ensure maximum power and profitability for the company – and that’s a job she
                        executes with ruthless efficiency. But her ambitions went beyond merely having superheroes
                        fighting crime on America’s streets; she desired to put them in the military, through a
                        multi-billion-dollar government contract.</div>

                        with his x-ray vision and then destroy it with his laser eyes. On the surface, he's affable,
                        modest, and sincere; the ultimate Boy Scout, an American treasure, a God-fearing patriot. But
